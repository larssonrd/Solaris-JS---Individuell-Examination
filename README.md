A website built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
The site provides details about the planets in our solar system by fetching data via API. Users can view specific information by clicking on a planet, and can also perform text searches for each planet using the search field.

This was our final exam for our Javascript course at Folkuniversitetet.
