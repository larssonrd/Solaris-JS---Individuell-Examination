# Solaris - Individuell-Examination FE22
A website built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
The site provides details about the planets in our solar system by fetching data via API. Users can view specific information by clicking on a planet, and can also perform text searches for each planet using the search field.

This was our final exam for our Javascript course at Folkuniversitetet.

# Requirements

- Be able to search for planets using text search.
- Display search results/planet in a visually appealing way.
